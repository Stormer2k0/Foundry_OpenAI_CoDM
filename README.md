Use this link to download the module: https://github.com/Stormer2k0/Foundry_OpenAI_CoDM/releases/latest/download/module.json

My first attemped at making a module.
This uses api calls to interact with the openai text-davinci-003 model.

First enter you api own API key in the settings.

Then simply type /openai "your question"
This models purpose is to be **CREATIVE**, it does some snippets of information and relations but will very likely be wrong if you ask it about anything real.

Asking the question "Give me 4 important npc's of waterdeep" will give some actual npc's, but half of the information will be wrong.
